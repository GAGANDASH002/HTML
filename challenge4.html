            <h2>Shovels</h2>
            <p>A shovel is a tool used for moving loose material. Shovels have a flat bottom head which is angled slightly from the handle to enable scooping and moving of material. Although a shovel can be used for digging, it is much less efficient than a spade. Spades are straight, and transmit force straight downwards.16</p>
